  I have always thought of coding as art and a form of self-expression. Having
  picked this hobby up in school, I have now turned it into my profession. My
  specialty is modern web and systems programming. Currently, I work primarily
  with C#, .NET, Azure and Docker. In this blog, I document adventures
  encountered during coding for work and my pet projects.
